# Terms of Use

As this service is still in a beta stage, we have yet to establish a firm set
of restrictions on how it may be used. We don't intend to use this ambiguity to
our advantage, but the reality is that we have yet to see the creative ways that
people may abuse the service.

Until such time as we have established a more concrete list of disallowed uses,
the following are our general rules of thumb. If you have clarifying questions 
or suggestions, please get in touch via [GitHub][github] and we will update this 
document accordingly.

* Do not use the service to gain unlawful access to systems that you would
  otherwise not be permitted to access.
  
* Do not use this service to facilitate activity that you are not lawfully
  permitted to do.
  
* Do not deliberately interfere with other users' usage of the ssh.st service.

* Do not use ssh.st tunnels to transfer terabytes of data between systems. 
  S3 is likely to be more reliable.
  
* Do not rely on this service as the sole means of connecting to your production
  infrastructure. Do not be upset with us if the 43 minutes of downtime per month 
  that our 99.9% uptime goal allows us corresponds with one of your prod incidents.
